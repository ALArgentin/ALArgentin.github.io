Research focus
======

Earth Surface Processes 

Study of the erosion and sediment transport processes happening at the Earth surface. I analyze topographic datasets, simulate erosion and hydrological regimes, and model sediment transport under climate change.

Natural Hazards 

Analysis of the risks originating from natural phenomenons. I simulate landslide and investigate the formation of landslide-dammed lakes and their impact on the river network.

3D Geomodeling

Modeling of subsurface geology using geomodeling software and development of algorithms for those software. I specialized in the structural modeling of the Pyrenees and in the simulation of fault networks and means to take into account branching uncertainty.

Landscapes Live online seminars
======
**Landscapes Live** is a weekly international online seminar series showcasing diverse topics in geomorphology. Affiliated to the EGU Geomorphology division, all talks are free, online and open to everyone.
